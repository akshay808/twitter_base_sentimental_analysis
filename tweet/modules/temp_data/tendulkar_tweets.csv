Cricket commentary should be clear of sponsorship and ads. #IPL2016"
725203691700002816,2016-04-27 06:03:28,Bhuvenshwar has all the makings of being an allrounder for India. He needs to keep swinging the call though. He lost swing sometime back.
725203453471907840,2016-04-27 06:02:31,Good to see a pacy wicket for the #SRHvRPS game. The ball was swinging too. Many modern batsmen not equipped to play in such conditions. Sad
725203221182980096,2016-04-27 06:01:36,"I love the way Ashwin Murugan is bowling this #IPL2016 
Basically I love spinners who really give it a tweak and spin the ball a long way."

717625639168180224,2016-04-06 08:10:59,Batsmen are hitting paddle sweeps to 140+ deliveries. Bowlers on the other hand struggling to bowl yorkers on will. @bhogleharsha

717263437911486464,2016-04-05 08:11:44,Unfortunately Pakistan cricket is what Indian cricket was 10 years back. With every loss a captain/coach is replaced https://t.co/Jr5xnQFnYr

716904815633141760,2016-04-04 08:26:42,Happy to see players like @imVkohli and Joe Root do so well in T20's. Have technique and skill? Will flourish in all forms of the game.
716904512045199360,2016-04-04 08:25:29,"India desperately needs to find classic spinners. Flight, dip, the works. The'll do very well in T20's. Jadeja should go."

716903777425469440,2016-04-04 08:22:34,Bowlers need to pull of their socks. Batsmen are hitting paddle sweeps to 140kmph deliveries. And bowlers still can't bowl yorkers on will?
716903470494646272,2016-04-04 08:21:21,To be honest I am a little worried that cricket will become a sports dominated by big strong players. @bhogleharsha
